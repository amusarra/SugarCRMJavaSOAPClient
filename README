This repository provides the source code examples developed for the article "Building a Java client for SugarCRM" posted on the blog http://musarra.wordpress.com.

The code samples are divided in this way:
* SOAPClient directory contains the SOAP client generated by the Apache Axis framework
* JavaApplication directory contains a sample Java application that communicates with SugarCRM using the SOAP library.
